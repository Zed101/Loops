Converting decimal to binary in Java

I'm trying to write a code that converts a number to binary, and this is what I wrote. It gives me couple of errors in Eclipse, which I don't understand. What's wrong with that? Any other suggestions? I'd like to learn and hear for any comments for fixing it. Thank you.

public class NumberConverte {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int i = Integer.parseInt(args);
    public static void Binary(int int1){
      System.out.println(int1 + "in binary is");
      do {
        System.out.println(i mod 2);
      } while (int1>0);
    }
  }
}
The error messages:

The method parseInt(String) in the type Integer is not applicable for the arguments (String[])
Multiple markers at this line
Syntax error on token "(", ; expected
Syntax error on token ")", ; expected
void is an invalid type for the variable Binary
Multiple markers at this line
Syntax error on token "mod", invalid AssignmentOperator

Integer.toBinaryString(int) should do the trick !

And by the way, correct your syntax, if you're using Eclipse I'm sure he's complaining about a lot of error.

Working code :

public class NumberConverter {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
       int i = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
       toBinary(i);
   }

   public static void toBinary(int int1){
       System.out.println(int1 + " in binary is");
       System.out.println(Integer.toBinaryString(int1));
   }
}

Although that's not much help for learning to program in Java! – Chimoo Mar 5 '11 at 13:13
  	 	
Another question. How do I get an input from a user? I probably should add something to the main function, Am I? – Unknown user Mar 5 '11 at 14:43
